This image is the first section in the level.
Because it is the first section, it will not be very difficult for the player to experience, this section is designed to allow players to become familiar with the gameplay of the game. My idea is to start from left to right. Players will be born on the far left side of the level and then move all the way to the right. In the process of going right, the player will get a weapon, the weapon is a close combat weapon, players need to get close to the enemy to defeat him. There are 2 types of weapons that players can get in the game, one is a close combat weapon which is one that player can get in the first section, the second one will be a ranged weapon, which is a gun, the players will get a ranged weapon later in the game. After Getting the weapon.




The player will encounter the first enemy called Chomper, Chomper is a close combat enemy, after the player goes at the range, Chomper will start to get closer and try to attack the player. Player will have 5 hp at the start if the Chomper did attack the player, the player will lose 1 hp, when the player hits the Chomper once, the Chomper will die. This part is for the player to experience how to attack the enemy, which will encounter more enemies on the way.




After that, the player has to push the box to the right wall, and then the player can jump over the wall and then reach two acids. The player will jump over one of them to reach another land before jumping over the second acid. the player will then move forward and find a save point, there is another acid at the front, but it is very big. The player needs to jump on the moving platform above to pass the acid. In this part the player is to experience how to jump though the acid and how to use a moving platform to go through the acid, there will be a lot of acid that the player needs to go though.




There are two ways the player can go, one way is to go down and face 2 Chomper and 1 Spitter. The player can experience a new enemy called Spitter, Spitter is a long range shooter, able to attack players within a certain distance. Another way is to go up into the cave. The cave is on the sky where the player needs to use a small portion of their parkour abilities, there will be one of the keys inside the cave which the player has to get to be able to finish the game.




Inside the cave. There is acid, 1 Spitter and a new trap for the player which is Spikes, Spikes will cause the player to lose 1 hp. jumping all over and killing Spitter, Player cannot very see what's below, there will be 1 Spikes at the right and are acid ar the left, If the player jumps without thinking of anything, he may hit a Spikers or go in thought the acid and die. This can be regarded as a Discovery, Drama and Exploration, because players don’t know what will be next and want to find out and die.




After all the things happen, the player finally has the first key and goes down at the short way to get out the cave, to go though the short way out there is a passthrough platform for the player to enter. but there are 3 enemies waiting for the player.




There are 3 enemies and 4 Spikes there, this is a bit of a challenge, the player will have to run to a good position and jump higher than they can to pass through the spikes without getting any damage. After all, this player finally can go to the next section.




In the next section, the player will enter the cave, have checkpoint 2 health and a gun waiting for the player to pick up. In the new section there will be a bit more challenge design for the player to play with.




Players will use the platform to jump up. This part is to let players get a little familiar with jumping, there will be many jumping mechanisms that players need to face later.


After having a gun player can shoot the enemy at a far distance, this scene is for the player to try using the gun to shoot at the spitter. After that the player will start facing 6 enemies, and the player will face an intense battle. Players need to resolve the battle quickly otherwise they will be losing, healing or dying. There will be a healing box on the left to heal the player after battle.


Go through the moving platform and reach the top where players will take the path to the second key. There will be many enemies, acid and spikes on the way to block the player grabbing the key. In this scene players need to use the experience learned in the first section to jump over traps and knock down enemies, of course it will be more challenging than the first section.


Upon reaching the location of the key, the second key will be more difficult than the first key, Here players will make good use of their jumping skills and combat skills, of course, this is not gonna be easy, there will be many enemies that will prevent you from getting the key, so the player needs to kill all the enemies as much as possible. In this case, the player can concentrate on jumping through the spikes to get the key and leave.


Jumping over the acid and the spikes in the middle, the player is about to enter the third section, there are many mechanisms and puzzles in this level that players need to explore and trigger.The level leading to the third key is blocked by the trigger door, player can only go down to find the switch that can open the door, To move to the left below, the player needs to move to the right first and turn on the button. Inside the right side there are acid spikes and 3 enemies are waiting for the player. There are two lands for players inside in acid, but these two lands are smaller than the previous ones and there are monsters on them, and spike at the end of the acid, this also tests the player skills and flexibility.


After the switch has been touched, the platform on the left will start moving, so the player can go through it.
The player needs to touch the switch below first to move the bridge on the left to the left and let the box fall. Then the pressure pad can be pressed out, which can open the trigger door and make the platform move so the player can go back to the trigger door.


After the door is open the player will start facing the harder scene in the game, This is a rectangular level with many platforms. There will be some spikes on different platforms to block players.Players need to move up step by step and avoid monster attacks to go to the upper right corner to get the key. If you fall down while playing, there will be acid waiting for the player below. This is the scene where players need to make good use of their parkour skills and dodge abilities.


After getting all the keys, the player can go to the door and end the game. Of course, there will also be mechanisms and enemies blocking the player's progress on the way to the gate.But these mechanisms will not be as difficult as before.


After passing these, there will be a gate, then the game ends.




### 1.1. Discovery
What does the player learn? How does your encounter and broader level design facilitate learning in a way that follows good design practice? 

In first section, the player will start Discovery all the basic in the game. Discove all the game mechanics and the enemies and traps that will appear in the game, for example, in the first section, I will let the players learn how to jump through the acid and the spikes, how to kill enemies, moving boxes and how to use moving platform. at the second section player will get a new weapon gun that is long range distance, allow player to kill the enemy in far distance.

In the senond and thired section, players will encounter more difficult mechanisms later on, player need to use the experience they learned in a first section. In the third seciton, the player will need to explore the cave and Discovery the switch to open the third key door.
### 1.2. Drama
What is the intensity curve? How does your design facilitate increasing yet modulating intensity, with moments of tension and relief? 

Intensity curve is usually the relationship between the intensity of challenge experienced by players in the game and the progress of the game. It is usually used to describe the difficulty in the game from high to low, and the highs and lows of difficulty in different stages of the game. There are also had intensity curve in the level, In first section will have all the basic level design for play discovery, let the play know what mechanics will show in this level. But in the key scene, the difficulty of the game will be further increased. Especially the second and third keys scenes will be more harder than the fitst key secene.
### 1.3. Challenge
What are the main challenges? How have you designed and balanced these challenges to control the difficulty curve and keep the player in the flow channel?

### 1.4. Exploration
How does your level design facilitate autonomy and invite the player to explore? How do your aesthetic and layout choices create distinct and memorable spaces and/or places?

## 2. Core Gameplay (~400 words)
A section on Core Gameplay, where storyboards are used to outline how you introduce the player to each of the required gameplay elements in the first section of the game. Storyboards should follow the format provided in lectures.

Storyboards can be combined when multiple mechanics are introduced within a single encounter. Each section should include a sentence or two to briefly justify why you chose to introduce the mechanic/s to the player in that sequence.

You should restructure the headings below to match the order they appear in your level.

### 2.1. Acid

### 2.2. Checkpoints

### 2.3. Chompers

### 2.4. Health Pickups

### 2.5. Keys

### 2.6. Moving Platforms

### 2.7. Passthrough Platforms

### 2.8. Spikes

### 2.9. Spitters

### 2.10. Weapon Pickup (Gun)

### 2.11. Weapon Pickup (Staff)

## 3. Spatiotemporal Design
A section on Spatiotemporal Design, which includes your molecule diagram and annotated level maps (one for each main section of your level). These diagrams may be made digitally or by hand, but must not be created from screenshots of your game. The annotated level maps should show the structure you intend to build, included game elements, and the path the player is expected to take through the level. Examples of these diagrams are included in the level design lectures.

No additional words are necessary for this section (any words should only be within your images/diagrams).
 
### 3.1. Molecule Diagram

### 3.2. Level Map – Section 1

### 3.3.	Level Map – Section 2

### 3.4.	Level Map – Section 3

## 4. Iterative Design (~400 words)
Reflect on how iterative design helped to improve your level. Additional prototypes and design artefacts should be included to demonstrate that you followed an iterative design process (e.g. pictures of paper prototypes, early grey-boxed maps, additional storyboards of later gameplay sequences, etc.). You can also use this section to justify design changes made in Unity after you drew your level design maps shown in section 3. 

You should conclude by highlighting a specific example of an encounter, or another aspect of your level design, that could be improved through further iterative design.

### Tool Used: ChatGPT
**Nature of Use** Finding relevant design theory.

**Evidence Attached?** Screenshot of ChatGPT conversation included in the folder "GenAI" in this repo.

**Additional Notes:** I used ChatGPT to try and find some more relevant design theory that I could apply to my game. After googling them, however, I found most of them were inaccurate, and some didn't exist. One theory mentioned, however, was useful, and I've incorporated it into my work.
